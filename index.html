    <h1 id='title'>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, my name is Gordon! Born and raised in Brooklyn NY, I am a first gen student at Cornell University
    beginning to venture into the tech industry. I am interested in interdisciplinary
    topics that combine tech, environmental science, and business.</p>
    <p>I am fueled by opportunities that give me the ability to shape
      technology that enables the world of social impact and also enables me to give back
      to the community. I consider myself a creative mind that is constantly looking to tackle
      problems in new innovative ways. Thus, Product Management is a role I am particularly
      fascinated with and want to explore.</p>
    <p>During the last few months, I have been looking for new ways to gain the
      skills needed to support my journey, as well as opportunities to gain experience
      as a Product Manager.

    <h2>Shower Power</h2>
    <p>Given current climate issues in the world, Shower Power is an interactive
      app that encourages users to think about conserving water and energy while
       they shower. Shower Power will time and promote the shortening of showers.
        Each successful shower that is finished within the given timeframe will hatch
     a mystery fish which users can add to their aquarium. </p>
       <p>Over the course of three months, <a href='https://alyssazhang.me/'>Alyssa</a> and I went through the ideation
         and prototyping/desiging sprints for this project. This is the first time I have gone through the product development cycle and see one of my ideas come to life. Going through user research,
     information architecture and designing every single fish was a rewarding experience.
     We are still currently working
  hard on "bringing this out of the water" (pun intended) on app stores! </p>
     <p>Check out the designs I made with Figma below!</p>

    <h2>Influencer Analytics</h2>
    <p>Influncer Analytics is a Tech and Marketing Consulting project team started over the summer of 2020.
    The goal of this team is to help small businesses gain more exposure during
  difficult times. We currently work with 3 different clients. <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/5dPMq5KBprrYUfg36PF5Gt">Scalescape</a>, a podcast based in Hong Kong,
    <a href="https://teespring.com/stores/craftee-space">CrafteeSpace</a>, an ecommerce brand, and <a href="http://www.phelpsforward.com/">Phelps Forward</a>, an organization that empowers female
    first-gen students. </p>
    <!--<iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vT3w2K0blQKbevFdAlRp-sqRKRaoinKk0DKtxqd6ZswnaakOZqhWzuJvnulCtO7zC1i_qjr8K45Ptsc/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000" width="960" height="569" ></iframe>
-->
    <p>On the team, I have focused more on the technical aspects. By scraping the Instagram
    pages of ScaleScape, I was able to keep track of their growth and look at the best times to post.
  I have also been working on designing and building the website for Influencer Analytics to share our story.</p>

     <h2>Spotify Decades Project</h2>
     <p>As avid music listeners, my group and I were curious as to how music trends and attributes
       have changed over the years. Using Spotify's API, we hoped to be able to find
       and visualize any changes that have occurred in the music industry over mainly
       the last two decades. Spotify Wrapped gives individual users a look at how
       they've listened to music via Spotify services, but we wanted to give a
       holistic analysis of the songs, among qualities like valence, tempo,
       acousticness, etc., in Spotify's API. Our Research Question is: Observing the top artists of the past two decades, how have music trends and characteristics changed over the years?
For example, is there a clear relation between energy and loudness of songs in each decade? And does that relationship stay true across the decades?</p>
     <p>Utilizing Jupyter notebook, Pandas and matplotlib, we were able to analyze the 2000 songs we scraped.</p>
